## Things to understand better

  - Jacobian transoformation: which coordinates are being applied where
  - Is the inverse of the matrix really the inverse of the coordinate transform, is that even what you want?

## Things to try

  - Propose lambda jumps between models
  - Check the exp/log prposals
